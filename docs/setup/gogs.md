# Gogs

Drone comes with built-in support for Gogs version `0.6` and higher. To enable Gogs you should configure the Gogs driver using the following environment variables:

```bash
REMOTE_DRIVER=gogs
REMOTE_CONFIG=https://gogs.hooli.com?open=false
```

## Gogs configuration

The following is the standard URI connection scheme:

```
scheme://host[:port][?options]
```

The components of this string are:

* `scheme` server protocol `http` or `https`.
* `host` server address to connect to. The default value is github.com if not specified.
* `:port` optional. The default value is :80 if not specified.
* `?options` connection specific options.

## Gogs options

This section lists all connection options used in the connection string format. Connection options are pairs in the following form: `name=value`. The value is always case sensitive. Separate options with the ampersand (i.e. &) character:

* `open=false` allows users to self-register. Defaults to false for security reasons.
* `skip_verify=false` skip ca verification if self-signed certificate. Defaults to false for security reasons.
